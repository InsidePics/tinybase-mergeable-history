Persistent, syncable, **CRDT-aware** undo/redo history for [TinyBase](https://tinybase.org).

TinyBase's built-in [`Checkpoints`](https://tinybase.org/api/checkpoints/) keep an undo stack in memory: it is lost on reload, scoped to a single client, and unaware of `MergeableStore` merges. `tinybase-mergeable-history` takes the opposite approach — **history is stored as data inside the store itself** (in a `_history` table). Because the history lives in the store, it travels with:

- **any Persister** → undo/redo survives reloads
- **any Synchronizer** → undo/redo is shared across clients
- **`MergeableStore`** → undo/redo are ordinary mergeable mutations, so reverting an action on one client merges cleanly with concurrent edits on another instead of desyncing peers
- **author attribution** → every action can be stamped with who made it, recorded as data so the attribution persists and syncs alongside the history

## Comparison

|                               | Built-in `Checkpoints` | `tinybase-mergeable-history`      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Storage                       | in-memory              | as data in the store (`_history`) |
| Survives reload               | ❌                     | ✅ (via any Persister)            |
| Shared across clients         | ❌                     | ✅ (via any Synchronizer)         |

## Install

```sh
pnpm add tinybase-mergeable-history tinybase
```

`tinybase` is a peer dependency (`^8.0.0`).

## Quick start

```ts
import { createStore } from 'tinybase';
import { createHistory } from 'tinybase-mergeable-history';

const store = createStore();
const history = createHistory(store);

// Wrap the mutations you want to be undoable in `action()`.
history.action(() => {
  store.setCell('pets', 'fido', 'sold', true);
});

history.canGoBackward(); // true
history.goBackward(); // undoes the action
history.canGoForward(); // true
history.goForward(); // redoes it
```

### With a MergeableStore (multi-client, CRDT)

```ts
import { createMergeableStore } from 'tinybase';
import { createHistory } from 'tinybase-mergeable-history';

const store = createMergeableStore('client-1');
const history = createHistory(store);

// Attach any persister / synchronizer as usual — the `_history`
// table travels with the store, so undo state persists and syncs,
// and undo/redo merge cleanly across clients.
```

## Author attribution

In a shared, multi-user store it is often useful to know **who** performed each undoable action. Pass a `getAuthor` callback and every recorded action stores its author alongside the delta, in the same `_history` row — so the attribution persists and syncs just like the rest of the history.

```ts
const history = createHistory(store, {
  getAuthor: () => currentUser.id, // called when an action is recorded
});

const actionId = history.action(() => {
  store.setCell('pets', 'fido', 'sold', true);
});

// Read it back from the history row:
const author = history.getStore().getCell('_history', actionId!, 'author');
```

`getAuthor` defaults to `() => ''` (no attribution). The author is captured at the moment the action is recorded, so it reflects whoever made the change — even after it is undone, redone, or synced to another client.

## API

### `createHistory(store, options?): History`

| option       | default      | description                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tableName`  | `'_history'` | table the history is stored in                                                           |
| `maxActions` | `200`        | maximum number of actions retained                                                       |
| `maxAge`     | `30 days`    | maximum age (ms) of retained actions                                                     |
| `getAuthor`  | `() => ''`   | returns an identifier for who is making the action; stored on the action's `author` cell |
| `generateId` | built-in     | action id generator                                                                      |
| `withBypass` | `fn => fn()` | wrap internal writes (e.g. to bypass your listeners)                                     |

### `History`

- `action(mutate): Id | undefined` — run `mutate` and record it as one undoable action
- `goBackward()` / `goForward()` — undo / redo
- `canGoBackward()` / `canGoForward(): boolean`
- `getActionIds(): [backward[], current, forward[]]`
- `setMaxActions(max)` / `setMaxAge(ms)` — tune retention
- `cleanup()` — prune now
- `addCleanupListener(listener)` / `delListener(id)` — observe pruning (cascade GC)
- `getStore(): Store`
- `destroy()` — remove listeners

### Schematized stores

If you use a Zod tables schema, spread in the history table schema so history writes are allowed:

```ts
import { historyTablesSchema } from 'tinybase-mergeable-history';

const tablesSchema = {
  ...historyTablesSchema,
  pets: z.object({ sold: z.boolean() }),
};
```

The history table schema includes the `author` cell used for attribution.

## How it works

Every `action()` runs inside a TinyBase transaction. A `willFinishTransaction` listener captures the transaction's cell and value changes and writes a single row to the history table holding the forward and reverse deltas, an `undone` flag, and the action's `author`. Undo and redo are themselves ordinary store mutations that flip `undone` and re-apply the relevant delta — which is exactly why they persist, sync, and merge like any other data.
